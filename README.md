# ReactMarketplace
A Marketplace built in React Native

In this project I challenged myself to create a real-world project using React Native/Javascript. I chose Web 3.0 because it is highly relevant at the moment. 

I used Visual Studio Code for the project and plan to use TDD and build an automated regression suite in Cypress or Appium.
