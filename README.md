# ReactNFTMarketplace
An NFT Marketplace built in React Native

In this project I challenged myself to create a real-world project using React Native/Javascript. I chose NFTs and Web 3.0 because they are both highly relevant at the moment. 

Having created my own NFTs over at https://rarible.com/cryptopups/sale I was interested to see how difficult it would be to actually develop a full blown NFT Platform end-to-end using React Native.

I used Visual Studio Code for the project and plan to use TDD and build an automated regression suite in Cypress or Appium.
